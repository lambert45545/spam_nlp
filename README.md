# Spam Detection with GloVe and CNN

## Overview

This project aims to detect spam using a combination of GloVe embeddings and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By leveraging pre-trained GloVe word embeddings and a CNN architecture, we enhance the ability to identify spam messages in various forms.

## Features

- **GloVe Embeddings:** Utilizes GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) pre-trained word embeddings for semantic understanding.
  
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** Employs a CNN architecture to capture local patterns and hierarchical representations for effective spam detection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies (specified in requirements.txt)
